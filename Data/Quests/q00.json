Now living in the hospice in the small coastal village of Charadeville, in Nourmandie, she asked me to visit her, regarding the disappearance of her son. After a long day traversing the gorgeous Francia’s countryside, from my office in Parisie to Nourmandie, I need a good night’s sleep before I visit her.",
